# HNL_FCCee_analytic
This project contains codes that generate analytic estimates for the sensitivity region of displaced vertex searches for Heavy Neutral Leptons based on the formular provided in [1].

So far there is only a Mathematica notebook [2], I plan to add a python/jupyter code soon.

The code can be freely used and modfied by anyone. I kindly ask to cite [1] when using the formulae or the codes in published work.
